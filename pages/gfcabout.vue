            <p>thank you for coming across the the group furry commission project(GFC)</p>

             <p>The concept of The project is to providea neutral benefit between both artists and commissioners artists benefit by having a singular task with a massive pay off, while alternatively the commissioners gain benefit and I large discount and being part of a large piece of work</p>

             <P> my job as part of the project is to provide verification I've artists andommissioners a community as well as organisation and communication between the multiple people of the project and the artist take load off the artist I also gather and collate reference information about each persons characters taking major load off the artist as well as streamlining the work</p>

             <p>as of now we have had two projects done with a third in The works done by some very great artists in my local communities if you look at the bottom of this you can see the art as well as links to their social media</p>

              <p>if you are commissioner and you want to get involved with the project feel free to have a look at the  links to the progress chats as well as the general chatter channel as well.</p>

              <p>If you are a artist wishing to get involved inone of these projects feel free to message me under the contact pagee on my website you can see it in the top bar.</p>
