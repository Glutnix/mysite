            <p>my main specialisations orientated around 3D printing and 3D design if you need a fursuit base fursuit
              parts mechanical parts for fursuit eyes I am open to people's ideas I can also do like finishing and
              painting if need be</p>
            <p>I do have a few basic things I do sell as listed below</p>

            <p>
              $75 for a pre-made base from an existing stock


              $125 for me to spend the time to design you a base based on your criteria, with the condition that
              your base once completed is free to people to buy for the tier above.
              <br>
              <br>

              $350 for a true one-of-a-kind base owned purely by you you even get to keep the file for personal use

              <br>
              <br>

              +$50 if you opt for semi flexible tpu which has the advantage of making it more crush resistance as
              well as slightly softing compared to petg
              <br>
              <br>
              +$30 for realistic base it's a little out of my comfort zone but I can manage.
